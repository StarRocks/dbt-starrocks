## Changelog Requirements

**All user-facing changes must be documented in CHANGELOG.md** following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

### How to Update

Add your changes under the `[Unreleased]` section:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Your PR here!

### Added
```

### Categories
- **Added**: New features
- **Changed**: Changes to existing functionality
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes
- **Removed**: Removed features

### What to Skip
Internal changes like CI/CD improvements, test updates, or refactoring don't need changelog entries.

### Note
Releases will fail if no changelog entry exists for the version being released.
